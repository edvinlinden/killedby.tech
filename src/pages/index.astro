			<h1>Killedby.tech have been deprecated</h1>
			<p>
				The inspiration for this site and a lot of the information came
				from other projects such as{" "}
				<a
					href="https://killedbygoogle.com/"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
				>
					Killed by Google
				</a>
				, by{" "}
				<a
					href="https://codyogden.com/"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
				>
					Cody Ogden
				</a>
				. But I wanted to create a directory that included all of the major
				tech companies, not only Google.
			</p>
			<p>
				Staying on top of the tech news and update the site with the
				latest discontinued products takes time, I have to prioritise
				other things.
			</p>
			<p>Therefore I am shutting the site down.</p>
